# using from npm

# how is it different from break on attribute modification

- track creation
- doesn't break every time any attr is modified
- view histoyr instead of momentary info

# where to use

- good for jquery/backbone/plain js code
- limitated usefulness for react etc because of indirections, but in those case
it's hopefully already clear why your DOM is updating
